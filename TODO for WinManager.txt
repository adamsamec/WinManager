* Replace casting to use the as keyword.
* Maybe change detection if WinManager is visible to check the foreground window handle.
* Differentiate between app closing using process.CloseMainWindow() and kill.
* Add about and help windows.
* Exclude some items like System host...
* Fix listing of Settings, Calculator and maybe some other modern apps.
